# Usage

## Templates

You have two options for `pinax-announcements` templates:

### 1. Use pre-built Bootstrap-based templates

This is the simplest method. `pinax-announcements` templates are found in the Pinax `pinax-theme-bootstrap` [theme project](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap). These templates work with the Bootstrap front-end framework as well as the Font Awesome icon library. If you [include](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap#getting-started) `pinax-theme-bootstrap` in your project these templates and icons are found and used automatically.

### 2. Create new templates

Just a bit more effortâ€”copy `pinax-theme-bootstrap` [templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap/tree/master/pinax_theme_bootstrap/templates/pinax/announcements) into your project and modify as needed.

For instance, if your project doesn't use Bootstrap, remove Bootstrap and Font Awesome class names from your templates copies. Remove class references like `class="btn btn-success"` and `class="icon icon-pencil"` as well as removing `bootstrap` from the `{% load i18n bootstrap %}` statement. Since `bootstrap` template tags and filters are no longer loaded, you'll also need to update `{{ form|bootstrap }}` to `{{ form }}` since the "bootstrap" filter is no longer available.


## Displaying Announcements

First load the template tags:

    {% load pinax_announcements_tags %}

Then fetch announcements with the `announcements` template tag:

    <h3>Announcements</h3>

    {% announcements as announcement_list %}

    {% if announcements_list %}
        <div class="announcements">
            {% for announcement in announcement_list %}
                <div class="announcement">
                    <strong>{{ announcement.title }}</strong><br />
                    {{ announcement.content }}
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    {% endif %}

If your announcement content is too large for viewing inline
then show a link to a detail view:

    <a href="{{ announcement.get_absolute_url }}">Read more...</a>

See [Template tags](./templatetags.md) for detail on pinax-announcements template tags.

## Dismissing Announcements

Add this markup to show a "Dismiss" link if available:

    {% if announcement.dismiss_url %}
        <a href="{{ announcement.dismiss_url }}" class="btn ajax" data-method="post" data-replace-closest=".announcement">
            Clear
        </a>
    {% endif %}

### Dismissal with Eldarion AJAX

The anchor markup shown above and the announcement dismissal view both conform
to an `AJAX` response that [eldarion-ajax](https://github.com/eldarion/eldarion-ajax) understands.
Furthermore, the templates that ship with this project will work
seemlessly with `eldarion-ajax`. All you have to do is include the
eldarion-ajax.min.js Javascript package in your base template:

    {% load staticfiles %}
    <script src="{% static "js/eldarion-ajax.min.js" %}"></script>

and include `eldarion-ajax` in your site JavaScript:

    require('eldarion-ajax');

This of course is optional. You can roll your own JavaScript handling as
the view also returns data in addition to rendered HTML. Furthermore, if
you don't want `ajax` at all the view will handle a regular `POST` and
perform a redirect.
